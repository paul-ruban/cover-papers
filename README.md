# **A Script For Document Preparation Automatization**

The documents that are processed duering the day at the Visa Center have to be prepared and dispatched to the Embassy for further processing.

To arrange the documents in a more comprehensive order cover papers are printed based for each nationality, service type and visa type. 

Previously, this task was carried out manually and at the end of the operational day it would take unnecessary 5 minutes to prepare the cover letters. Sometimes, a small mistake in data entry resulted in wasted paper as well.

With this script the end of the day report in .xls or .xlsx is taken as an input and the output excel file is produced with all the cover papers in the same sheet. 

The visa officer has to specify what report file is to be processed and the target directory for the output file. The output file does not require specfying the range of pages to be printed.
